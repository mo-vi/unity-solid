# SOLID principles

Unity examples

## Single responsibility

## Open closed

## Liskov substitution
In this example we have Enemy subclasses that potentially handle TakeDamage() in different ways and at the same time they don't break the application nor the superclass itself. For example, EnemyGolem.cs uses its parent definition

## Interface segregation

## Dependency inversion
